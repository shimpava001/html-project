  <h2>What are the chances to geting shiny Pokemon? </h2>
  <h3>The chance of getting a shiny pokemon is 1 in 4096. But there is a way to make the chances higher! By doing the catch combo method. This has more chance than the musudo method
    which cannot be performed in this game. So catch combos are the best thing in this games. </h3>
  <h2>What is a catch combo?</h2>
  <h3>Catch combos are made when you catch a pokemon. if you catch the same pokemon many times your catch combo increases, but there are some things that will break a catch combo.</h3>

  <h2>What will break catch combos?</h2>
  <h3>In this game three things can break catch combos. For instance catching another Pokemon then the pokemon you were comboing will break the combo, closing the game will break the
      combo, and letting the pokemon of your combo run away from you will break the combo. </h3>
  <h2>How to increase the chance of shiny pokemon. </h2>
  <h3>Now that you know about combos lets talk about chances. </h3>

  <h1>Items you should have when hunting.</h1>
  <h3>If you don't have the right items the shiny Pokemon can get away thats why it is always important to be prepared.</h3>
  <h3>You should have some ultra balls or the kind of poke ball that is the best in the shop for now. </h3>
  <h3> You should also have berries so that the catch rate slightly increases. Slightly is better then nothing.
  <h1>Happy hunting!
